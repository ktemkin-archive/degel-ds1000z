# de-GEL for the Rigol DS1000Z.

de-GEL is a small utility written by Christopher D. Granz to extract RIGOL "GEL"
firmware files.

## DS-1000Z Version
This version has been modified to work with the DS-1000Z by ~ktemkin.

After taking a peek at the Rigol file format himself, I was lucky enough to
stumble upon the de-GEL utility for the very-close GEL format used by other
Rigol devices. A minor tweak, and it works for the DS-1000Z.
